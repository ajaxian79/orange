# Orange

A C++ app framework allowing for creation of clean Dear ImGUI Applications

## Credits

While this framework did not start as a fork of https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut an absolute metric ton of code 
was pulled from there, some was adapted and some remains the same.

## Intentions

I need a clean easy application framework for several commercial applications I will be writing, I considered starting
from Walnut but my aim is for my applications to be crossplatform and my current linux setup does not have Vulkan support
so for my personal use case a solution that uses OpenGL3 on Linux statically linked is better additionally I intend to
heavily modify this framework and add widgets to it directly to support my needs.
